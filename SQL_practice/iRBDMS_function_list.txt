SELECT:
    go through entire database,
    check for conditions,
    create new database object accordingly
INSERT:
    add new entry at end of database
UPDATE:
    change value of row(s)
DELETE:
    delete rows that fit criteria/entire table(!)

CREATE TABLE:
    creates table. Let there be light.
ALTER TABLE:
    ADD COLUMN
    DROP COLUMN
    MODIFY COLUMN
    other stuff I won't get into just now
TRUNCATE TABLE:
    empty table
DROP TABLE:
    delete not just the table data, but send the table itself to the shadow realm

-columns referenced by name, order not relevant
-rows referenced by index or primary key, order important
-data not sparse
-approximate expected column count: low (up to 20, probably under 10)
-approximate expected row count: high (significantly more than 20)

Divide twodimensional structure into two:
    the external one that contains rows
    the internal one that contains a row's data points
    rowc=row count
    colc=col count

Choice of external structure (internal structure operation assumed to be O(1)):
Regular array
    SELECT: O(rowc)
    INSERT: amortised O(1)
    UPDATE: O(rowc)
    DELETE: O(rowc)
    CREATE: O(n)
    ALTER: O(col)
    TRUNCATE: O(1) or O(n) if no garbage collection
    DROP: same as truncate
